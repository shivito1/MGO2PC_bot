# MGO2PC
This project aims to make an auto host bot.

# Currently
This scrip can detect chat text via color. It then uses OCR (tesseract) to extract the text.

# Future goal
- Have bot listen for key words and respond or start a vote.
- Give players the power to block players from the room (voting)
- Through vote have bot recreate room as MIX, RES, TSNE, etc...
- launch/reboot rpcs3 if needed for game stability.
